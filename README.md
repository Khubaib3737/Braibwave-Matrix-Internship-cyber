# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Link Scanner ‚Äî Task 1

A lightweight Python tool built for the **Brainwave Cybersecurity Internship**, this script analyzes and detects potentially malicious or phishing URLs using simple heuristics ‚Äî without relying on APIs or external services.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Analyze a **single URL** via console input  
- Analyze **multiple URLs** from a `.txt` file  
- Detects:
  - IP-based URLs
  - Obfuscation via `@` symbol
  - Suspicious keywords (e.g., `login`, `verify`, `secure`)
  - Unsecure `http://` usage
  - Long URLs
  - Hidden redirects using `//`
  - Too many subdomains  
- Outputs results to both **console** and **`output_report.txt`**  
- Minimal dependencies ‚Äî built using only Python‚Äôs standard library  

---

## üìÅ Files

- `Phishing_Link_Scanner_Task1.py` ‚Üí Main phishing detection script  
- `urls.txt` ‚Üí (Optional) Input file with one URL per line  
- `output_report.txt` ‚Üí Output file generated during file-based scan  

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No third-party libraries required  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

To run the script, open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell), navigate to the folder containing the file, and type:

`python Phishing_Link_Scanner_Task1.py`

You‚Äôll see a prompt:

== Phishing Link Scanner ==

Scan a single URL

Scan multiple URLs from a file
Choose (1 or 2):


If you enter `1`, it will ask:

`Enter a URL to scan:`

You can input something like:

`http://login-secure-paypal.com`

It will analyze the URL and display results directly in the console.

If you enter `2`, it will ask:

`Enter input file path (.txt):`

You can type:

`urls.txt`

Make sure `urls.txt` contains one URL per line, like:
http://example.com
http://login-secure.paypal.com
https://www.google.com
http://192.168.0.1/login



The tool will scan each URL, print results in the console, and also save them to `output_report.txt` in the same directory.

## üí° Scoring Logic

Each URL is scored from 0 to 7 based on the following suspicious features:

| Feature                     | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `has_ip`                   | Raw IP address in domain                         |
| `has_at_symbol`            | `@` symbol used to mislead users                 |
| `url_length`               | Length > 75 characters                           |
| `has_http`                 | Uses `http://` instead of `https://`             |
| `has_double_slash_redirect`| Too many `//` (e.g., redirect tricks)            |
| `subdomain_count`          | 3 or more subdomains                             |
| `suspicious_words`         | Phishing-related keywords (login, bank, etc.)    |

### Verdict:
- **Score ‚â• 3** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Phishing Likely  
- **Score < 3** ‚Üí ‚úÖ URL Seems Safe

## üì¶ Convert to .exe (Optional)

If you want to run the tool as a Windows executable (.exe) without Python installed:

1. Install PyInstaller by running: `pip install pyinstaller`  
2. Open terminal in the script directory and run:  
   `pyinstaller --onefile --console Phishing_Link_Scanner_Task1.py`  
3. After it finishes, your `.exe` file will be located in the `dist/` folder as:  
   `dist/Phishing_Link_Scanner_Task1.exe`

Double-click it or run it in terminal like any normal program.
